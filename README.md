# Polynomial-Calculator--Java

The main objective of this project is to design and implement a system for polynomial processing. Considering the polynomials of one variable and having integer coefficients.  To achieve such a goal, we have to implement all the possible operations on the polynomials and those are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, derivation and integration
